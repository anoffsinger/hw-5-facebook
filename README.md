## Facebook

The purpose of this homework is to leverage animations and gestures to transition between screens. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement some interactions in Facebook.

Time spent: `8 hours`

### Features

#### Required

- [x] Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
- [ ] Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
- [ ] On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
- [ ] If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.

#### Optional

- [ ] The full screen photo should be zoomable.
- [ ] The user should be able to page through the other photos in full screen mode.

#### The following **additional** features are implemented:

N/A

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to understand how to get the image to appear full screen at the correct aspect ratio - when I'm bringing it in, it had the incorrect aspect ratio
2. I would like to understand why my done button stopped working when I hooked up the custom transition file

### Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

In general, I failed at this assignment. I gave it my all, rewatched the lecture videos, and just couldn't piece it together. I'll have to work on custom transitions further while building the Places app, because I have a similar (albeit less complicated) photo takeover paradigm too.
